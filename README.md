# Score
## A Simple Gradebook for Bellevue School District
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElliotGluck/Score.svg?branch=hhvm-branch)](https://travis-ci.org/ElliotGluck/Score)
#### Abstract
> Form follows function
Beginning in the 2017-18 school year, the Bellevue School District switched from the Aspen gradebook to StudentVue/Synergy. While Aspen was no masterpiece, Synergy left a lot to be desired, so we decided to reverse engineer it and make it better, and easier, for us and other students.

#### API
> "Functional Programming" - [mcklyde](https://github.com/mcklyde)
Score is based off of the [mcklyde/SynergisticGism](https://github.com/mcklyde/SynergisticGism) API, written in Elixir. It is used as a wrapper that converts RESTful, JSON API calls that are developer friendly, to gross and ugly XML calls that Synergy can understand. It then takes the hideous XML response and converts it back into a RESTful JSON response.

#### Design
Synergy is cluttered, non responsive, and looks like it is straight out of the 1990's web 1.0. We used Webflow to design the frontend experience, to make certan it is functional and beautiful across all devices and platforms.

#### Getting Started
You can host this project on almost any run of the mill PHP 7 web server, but we recommend using an HHVM stack for better performance. There are no artisan or composer prerequisits unless you do opt to use HHVM.
